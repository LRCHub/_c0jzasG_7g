(Mucky)
(We're mucky)
Ridin' in that old school chevy with the top back
Butterfly doors, watch 'em flutter when I stop that
Game in my palm ain't no way I'll ever drop that
Big stain drippin' on the road, you can mop that
Manchild, violent, exodus war
Should've thought twice now I'm at your front door like, boom!
Run up ya staircaseblack club
Balaclava, no face, no case
No charges, man better keep it a bar sting
Short hair, still get a parting
Mic or no mic, get clarting
Think it's a jolting, trust me man are not ma
It's x, it's on
Man are get shook like bubbly 3D
MC, weed and boys, it's like Dudley
Trust me, man are get tackled like rugby
X it's on, we're straight cruddy
If you don't know, learn and study
I'm a fully grown pit for these puppies
This ain't no wolf pack, we're mucky
(Mop that, mop that, mop that, mop that)
(Ridin' in that old school chevy with the top back)
(Butterfly doors, watch 'em flutter when I stop that)
(Game in my palm ain't no way I'll ever drop that)
(Mop that)
(We're mucky)
Ridin' in that old school chevy with the top back
Butterfly doors, watch 'em flutter when I stop that
Game in my palm ain't no way I'll ever drop that
Big stain drippin' on the road, you can mop that
Manchild, violent, exodus war
Should've thought twice now I'm at your front door like, boom!
Run up ya staircaseblack club
Balaclava, no face, no case
No charges, man better keep it a bar sting
Short hair, still get a parting
Mic or no mic, get clarting
Think it's a jolting, trust me man are not ma
It's x it's on
Man are get shook like bubbly 3D
MC, weed and boys, it's like Dudley
Trust me, man are get tackled like rugby
X it's on, we're straight cruddy
If you don't know, learn and study
I'm a fully grown pit for these puppies
This ain't no wolf pack, we're mucky
(Mop that, mop that, mop that, mop that)
(Mop that, mop that, mop that, mop that)
(Mucky)
